STAR DeFi Platform — Complete Project Brief

Objective

Build a premium-level DeFi dApp called STAR using the Scaffold Stellar framework, demonstrating speed and efficiency.

Requirements:

1. Deployed Smart Contract: Must be created and deployed on Stellar (Rust → WASM). Smart contract handles token creation, airdrops, liquidity, and vesting.


2. Frontend: Fully functional UI using TypeScript + React (Vite).


3. Stellar Wallet Kit Integration: For wallet connections and transactions.


4. README File: Must include setup instructions, folder structure, how to run frontend, connect to smart contract, and platform workflow explanation.



Note: Backend blockchain logic is handled via the smart contract; frontend handles UI, user interactions, STAR points, and project display.

Step 1:

Name, Symbol, Supply, Decimals, Description, Optional Social links


Step 2:

Set percentages: Airdrop Supply, Creator Supply, Liquidity Supply


Step 3:

Minimum Liquidity Requirement (e.g., 500 XLM)

Optional Team Vesting

Participation Period: Min 3 days, Max 15 days


Post-Creation:

Project auto-appears on Launch Page with logo & full details.

Smart contract locks airdrop supply and liquidity.

Creator wallet instantly receives their token portion.

Tokens automatically launch on DEX after campaign ends with locked liquidity.

Platfarm Points (STAR Points)

Users mint points: 1 XLM = 10 STAR points.

Displayed as 3D STAR token UI.

Points used for project participation:

50% burned
